# Entity Mapper

An **Entity** is a POJO representing data that can be persisted to the database

Each **Entity** could contain :

- 1..1 **@Table** annotation that represent database table name
- 0..1 **@Cacheable** annotation that define an Entity as cacheable
- 1..N **@Column** annotated fields that represent column in database table
- 0..N **@Id** annotated fields that represent a key column in database table
- 0..N **@Converter** annotated fields that represent a logical conversion between a sql type,
and a custom/not supported type
- 0..N **@Relationship** annotated fields that represent a logical relationship between two database tables
- 0..N **@Cascade** annotated fields that are affected by operation done on parent entity

For each **@Column** annotated fields , user must also define a getter, and a setter for that field

A standard Constructor with no args must also be provided

```java
import io.github.ulisse1996.jaorm.annotation.*;
import io.github.ulisse1996.jaorm.entity.converter.BooleanIntConverter;

import java.util.List;

@Table(name = "TABLE_NAME")
@Cacheable
public class Entity {

    @Id(autoGenerated = true)
    @Column(name = "COLUMN_1")
    private String column1;

    @Column(name = "COLUMN_2")
    private int column2;

    @Column(name = "READ_CONFIRM")
    @Converter(BooleanIntConverter.class)
    private boolean aBoolean;

    @Relationship(columns =
      @Relationship.RelationshipColumn(sourceColumn = "COLUMN_1", targetColumn = "COLUMN_REF_1")
    )
    @Cascade(CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<RefEntity> refEntities;

    // Getter and Setter omitted for brevity
}
```
