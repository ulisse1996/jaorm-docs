==== 1.1.1 Id (Primary/Unique Key)

In contrast to JPA or others ORM , Jaorm does not use compound id class

User can declare one or more *@Id* annotation in a single entity that are used to define how Entity must be selected, updated and deleted from database

Jaorm use each *@Id* for create specifics where conditions

An *@Id* annotation can also be marked as auto-generated.

TIP:  Jaorm retrieve and set auto-generated keys during persist events
